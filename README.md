## COVID SEIR Model:
This repository presents an abstraction of the [COEXIST Model](https://github.com/gbohner/coexist) which was developed for COVID modeling in the UK. This version of COEXIST enables a modeler to run COEXIST over arbitrary geospatial areas. It is an enhanced SEIR model purpose-built to predict health state progression for COVID, but can be updated for different viruses. 

To run the COVID model, the user must have access to basic virus and hospitalization data for their geographic region.  For a new virus, an expert level of knowledge is required to properly calibrate the input parameters.

See the COEXIST license agreement at the end of this README.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to abstract the UK COEXIST model to provide a robust and geographic-agnostic COVID SEIR model. The model is abstracted by:

  - Allowing the model to run for any geopolitical area of interest
  - Identifing and classifing input parameters by source. For instance, some parameters such as population are readily available; while others such as baseline hospital admission rates may require expert input to come to reasonable estimations.
  - Reducing the exposed input parameters to modelers to allow for easier model calibration and exploration
  - Drastic simplification of input and parameter space; multiple spreadsheets were able to be boiled down into simple JSON parameter files

## COEXIST Model Overview
COEXIST (COVID Exit Strategy) was developed to inform COVID-related policy decisions for the UK government by investigating the effects of testing protocols, social distancing, and quarantining.  The model was purpose-built for the UK with extensive supporting data provided by the National Health Service. Note, the CHESS data referenced in the repository is protected and unavailable. Our code obviates the need for this CHESS data by allowing the modeler to provide the latest testing data (e.g. yesterday's data) available directly to the simulation.

For an extensive model description as well as acces to the original source code, see the [COEXIST Model](https://github.com/gbohner/coexist) repository.

## Input Parameters
Our variant of the COEXIST model reduces the initial data collection/cleaning requirements by: 
  
1. aggregating applicable inputs to a single input,
2. leveraging subject matter expertise to estimate parameters assumed to inaccesible to the average general modeler, and
3. only exposing parameters that a general modeler would reasonably have access to for their chosen geography.

We seperate the input parameter requirements into three broad categories: 1) SME parameters, 2) General Modeler Parameters, and 3) Social Mixing Matrices where each category has its own distinct groupings. Below is a description of each required parameter for the three categories.

### SME Parameter Category:
SME parameters are assumed to require subject matter expertise for detailed baseline hospital and COVID data for the geographic area of interest. Parameters are updated in the `sme_input.json` file [HERE](https://github.com/jataware/COEXIST/blob/main/inputs/sme_input.json). For practical steps in populating the `sme_input.json` and running the model, see the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section. The two SME Parameter Groups are:

  1. **Age-Group Parameters**. These are baseline, not COVID-related hospital data where each parameter is binned into the following age blocks according to the descriptions below:

  **Age-Groups**:  "0-9", "10-19", "20-29",  "30-39",  "40-49", "50-59", "60-69", "70-79", "80+"


  If your data does not match these age groupings, you can either interpolate your data to fit these blocks or rely on the built in helper function `regroup_by_age` in the model that re-allocates your data into the appropriate bins. Care should be taken when relying on the function and binning results should be verified.

  <center>

  | Parameter | Description             |
  | --------- | ----------------------- |
  | "agePopulationTotal" | By age-group, the total population in that age-group |
  | "yearly\_baseline\_admissions"| By age-group, the total number of patients admitted to the hospital  over the course of a year 
  | "ageHospitalMeanLengthOfStay" | By age-group, a patient’s average length of stay in the hospital 
  | "ageNhsClinicalStaffPopulationRatio" | By age-group, the percentage of that age-group that are hospital staff
  | "riskOfAEAttandance_by_age" | By age-group, the number of emergency hospital admissions divided by the age-group population total
  </center>


2. **Health-State Parameters**. COVID-related data. Each value is binned sequentially into the following Health States:
 
  [“E”, “A”, “I1”, “I2”] which translates to: 

 [“Very weakly virus positive”, “Weakly virus positive”, “Strongly virus positive”, “Medium virus positive / Weakly IgM antibody positive”]

   
  In these Health States someone is infected and can therefore possibly be hospitalized or infect someone else they contact.

  <center>

  | Parameter    | Description             |
  | ------------ | ----------------------- |
  | "transmissionInfectionStage"|The rate of transmission given contact and your current Health State. For example, if transmissionInfectionStage = [0.001, 0.1, 0.6, 0.5] and you are Asymptomatic there is a 10% chance you will infect someone you contact; a 60% chance if you are in the “Early/High Viral load” health state.|
  | "infToHospitalExtra" | Extra rate of hospitalization above baseline given current Health State. For example if infToHospitalExtra = [1e-4, 1e-3, 2e-2, 1e-2] and you are `Asymptomatic` ("A") there is a 0.10% chance you will be admitted to the hospital; a 2.0% chance if you are in the `Early/High Viral load` ("I2") health state. Note: This is difficult to approximate due to the high number of unknown cases.
  
  </center>
  
    - Note that these parameters are _independent_ of age


### General Modeler Parameter Category:
General Modeler Parameters are assumed to be readily available and open to the public for the geographic area of interest. Parameters are updated in the `user_input.json` file [HERE](https://github.com/jataware/COEXIST/blob/main/inputs/user_input.json). For practical steps in populating the `user_input.json` and running the model, see the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section. The three General Modeler Parameter Groups are:

  1. **Age-Group Parameters**. Each parameter is binned into the following age blocks according to the descriptions below:

  **Age-Groups**:  "0-9", "10-19", "20-29",  "30-39",  "40-49", "50-59", "60-69", "70-79", "80+"


  If your data does not match these age groupings, you can either interpolate your data to fit these blocks or rely on the built in helper function `regroup_by_age` in the model that re-allocates your data into the appropriate bins. Care should be taken when relying on the function and binning results should be verified.

  <center>

  | Parameter | Description             |
  | --------- | ----------------------- |
  | "percent_admitted" | By age-group, the percent of patients admitted to the hospital due to COVID |
  | "deaths\_by\_age" | By age-group, the total count of COVID deaths
  | "ageHospitalMeanLengthOfStay" | By age-group, a patient’s average length of stay in the hospital 
  | "percent\_not\_isolating" | By age-group, the percent of people not adhering to isolation requirements

  </center>


2. **Start/Stop Parameters**. Set the start date for the simulation, filter data, and  choose the start and stop dates for the available policies.

  **NOTE**: All dates are formatted **`YYYY-MM-DD`** unless otherwise noted.


  <center>

  | Parameter    | Description             |
  | ------------ | ----------------------- |
  | "testingStartDate"| Datetime to start the simulation
  | "tStartSocialDistancing"| Datetime to start Social Distancing Policy
  | "tStopSocialDistancing"| Datetime to stop Social Distancing Policy
  | "tStartImmunityPassports"| Datetime to start Immunity Passport Policy
  | "tStopImmunityPassports" | Datetime to stop Immunity Passport Policy
  | "tStartQuarantineCaseIsolation" | Datetime to start Quarantine Policy
  | "tStopQuarantineCaseIsolation" | Datetime to stop Quarantine Policy
  | "testingStartDate"| Datetime to begin simulation
  | "CONST\_DATA\_START\_DATE" | Start data for data ingestion; used to filter out data before this date if the data is of poor quality. **Format `YYYYMMDD`**
  | "CONST\_DATA\_CUTOFF\_DATE" | Stop data for data ingestion; used to filter out data after this date if the data is of poor quality. **Format `YYYYMMDD`**


3. **Policy Parameter**. A parameter set by government policy.

  <center>
  
  | Parameter | Description             |
  | --------- | ----------------------- |
  | "nDaysInHomeIsolation" | Number of days that exposed or infected people are required to isolate |
  </center>

### Social Mixing Matricies Category:
Social Mixing Matricies estimate, by age group, the average number of daily social interactions someone has with other people. There are two variants: 1) `social_mixing_BASELINE` which reflects non-COVID or "normal" social mixing ([example](https://github.com/jataware/COEXIST/blob/main/inputs/social_mixing_BASELINE.json)), and 2) `social_mixing_DISTANCE` which reflects a reduced number of interactions due to social mixing policies ([example](https://github.com/jataware/COEXIST/blob/main/inputs/social_mixing_DISTANCE.json)).

The examples provided are an average of several social mixing matrices from survey data available [HERE](http://www.socialcontactdata.org/tools/). When using the tool, the age-groups need to be defined by the 10-year blocks as shown in the other input parameter categories. In the `mixing` directory the notebook `mixing_comparison.ipynb` has examples on how to compare and average social mixing interactions for different countries.

You may update the social mixing matrices which are defaulted for the UK. In the future we plan to build software to make this process less cumbersome

## Quick Start:

### 1. Run from published Docker Image:
NOTE: The data in the published image is for the United Kingdom. To change the input parameters you will need to update the input parameter files.

1. run `git clone https://github.com/jataware/COEXIST.git` 
2. run `cd your/local/folder/COEXIST/inputs` 
3. In the inputs directory, update the `sme_input.json` and `user_input.json` files as described above. You may also update `social_mixing_BASELINE.csv` and `social_mixing_DISTANCE.csv` files (or use the UK default)
4. run `cd ~/COEXIST`
5. run `docker run -v $PWD/inputs:/COEXIST/inputs -v $PWD/results:/COEXIST/results jataware/coexist -days=<numberOfSimDays> -out=<outfile>.csv`
   where:
  
	- `-days` = number of days to run simulation
	- `-out` = name of output `.csv` file

5. Simulation results are written to the your local `results` folder.

### 2. Build your own Docker Image:
To build a docker image and run a container:

1. run `git clone https://github.com/jataware/COEXIST.git` 
2. run `cd your/local/folder/COEXIST/inputs` 
3. In the inputs directory, update the `sme_input.json` and `user_input.json` files as described above. You may also update `social_mixing_BASELINE.csv` and `social_mixing_DISTANCE.csv` files (or use the UK default)
4. run `cd ~/COEXIST`
5. Verify `Dockerfile` is in your current working directory
6. Launch Docker from command line or the Docker app
7. run `docker  build . -t coexist` to build an image named `coexist`
8. run `docker run --rm coexist -days=<numberOfSimDays> -out=<outfile>.csv` to run your model instantiation
   where:
  
	- `-days` = number of days to run simulation
	- `-out` = name of output `.csv` file


### 3. Local Run (no Docker needed):

1. Clone the [COEXIST](https://github.com/jataware/COEXIST) repository to `your/local/folder`.
2. run `cd ~/COEXIST && pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. run `cd ~/inputs`
4. In the inputs directory, update the `sme_input.json` and `user_input.json` files as described above. You may also update `social_mixing_BASELINE.csv` and `social_mixing_DISTANCE.csv` files (or use the UK default)
5. run `cd ~/COEXIST`
6. run `python3 coexist.py -days=180 -out=results.csv` 

   where:
  
	- `-days` = number of days to run simulation
	- `-out` = name of output `.csv` file
	

## Output Description:
When the model run is complete, your `<outfile>.csv` file is written to `~/results/<outfile>.csv`. The output is a csv file with the following columns:

  - `timestamp`: number of days (in YYYY-MM-DD format) from your simulation `testingStartDate` as defined in the `user_input.json`
  - `simDay`: integer number of days from your simulation `testingStartDate` as defined in the `user_input.json`
  - `arrivalType`: the method of Health State count for each day. Options include:
  
		 -  `new`: Health States reflect daily count of new arrivals
		 -  `current`: Health States reflect total daily count of people in the state
  - `ageGroup`: 10-year age-group blocks
  - `healthState`: the Health State 
  - `value`: The daily count of people for the row's simulation day, arrival type, age group, and health state

Example slice of the output dataframe on the first simulation day (initial) for the 0-9 Age Group :
<center>

| timestamp  | simDay | arrivalType | ageGroup | healthState | value |
| ---------- | -------|----------- | -------- | ----------- | ------|
| 2020-12-15 | 1 | current | 0-9 |susceptible| 6,795,024 |
| 2020-12-15 | 1 | current | 0-9 |exposed | 0.0 |
| 2020-12-15 | 1 | current | 0-9 |asymptomatic | 0.0 |
| 2020-12-15 | 1 | current | 0-9 |infected1 | 0.0 |
